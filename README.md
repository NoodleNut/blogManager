# blogManager
A platform for changing web content on a remote server automatically.

While creating my website I realized I wanted to be able to add blog content easily and from wherever I wanted.

blogManager allows you to upload media and text content, send it to your site's client and have it automatically injected via two way data binding.

#Future Plans
Next steps involve being able to delete and update blogs via blogManager as well. 
I plan to incorporate passport.js for user authentication and have this become a fully fledged API
